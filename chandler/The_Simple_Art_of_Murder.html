  <h1>The Sim­ple Art of Mur­der—An Es­say</h1><p>Fic­tion in any form has al­ways in­tend­ed to be re­al­is­tic. Old-fash­ioned
nov­els which now seem stilt­ed and ar­ti­fi­cial to the point of bur­lesque
did not ap­pear that way to the peo­ple who first read them. Writ­ers like
Field­ing and Smol­lett could seem re­al­is­tic in the mod­ern sense be­cause
they dealt large­ly with un­in­hib­it­ed char­ac­ters, many of whom were about
two jumps ahead of the po­lice, but Jane Austen’s chron­i­cles of high­ly
in­hib­it­ed peo­ple against a back­ground of rur­al gen­til­i­ty seem real
enough psy­cho­log­i­cal­ly. There is plen­ty of that kind of so­cial and
emo­tion­al hypocrisy around to­day. Add to it a lib­er­al dose of
in­tel­lec­tu­al pre­ten­tious­ness and you get the tone of the book page in
your dai­ly pa­per and the earnest and fatu­ous at­mos­phere breathed by
dis­cus­sion groups in lit­tle clubs. These are the peo­ple who make best
sell­ers, which are pro­mo­tion­al jobs based on a sort of in­di­rect snob
ap­peal, care­ful­ly es­cort­ed by the trained seals of the crit­i­cal
fra­ter­ni­ty, and lov­ing­ly tend­ed and wa­tered by cer­tain much too pow­er­ful
pres­sure groups whose busi­ness is sell­ing books, al­though they would
like you to think they are fos­ter­ing cul­ture. Just get a lit­tle be­hind
in your pay­ments and you will find out how ide­al­is­tic they are.</p><p>The de­tec­tive sto­ry for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons can sel­dom be pro­mot­ed. It
is usu­al­ly about mur­der and hence lacks the el­e­ment of up­lift. Mur­der,
which is a frus­tra­tion of the in­di­vid­ual and hence a frus­tra­tion of the
race, may have, and in fact has, a good deal of so­ci­o­log­i­cal
im­pli­ca­tion. But it has been go­ing on too long for it to be news. If the
mys­tery nov­el is at all re­al­is­tic (which it very sel­dom is) it is
writ­ten in a cer­tain spir­it of de­tach­ment; oth­er­wise no­body but a
psy­chopath would want to write it or read it. The mur­der nov­el has also
a de­press­ing way of mind­ing its own busi­ness, solv­ing its own prob­lems
and an­swer­ing its own ques­tions. There is noth­ing left to dis­cuss,
ex­cept whether it was well enough writ­ten to be good fic­tion, and the
peo­ple who make up the half-mil­lion sales wouldn’t know that any­way. The
de­tec­tion of qual­i­ty in writ­ing is dif­fi­cult enough even for those who
make a ca­reer of the job, with­out pay­ing too much at­ten­tion to the
mat­ter of ad­vance sales.</p><p>The de­tec­tive sto­ry (per­haps I had bet­ter call it that, since the
Eng­lish for­mu­la still dom­i­nates the trade) has to find its pub­lic by a
slow process of dis­til­la­tion. That it does do this, and holds on
there­after with such tenac­i­ty, is a fact; the rea­sons for it are a study
for more pa­tient minds than mine. Nor is it any part of my the­sis to
main­tain that it is a vi­tal and sig­nif­i­cant form of art. There are no
vi­tal and sig­nif­i­cant forms of art; there is only art, and pre­cious
lit­tle of that. The growth of pop­u­la­tions has in no way in­creased the
amount; it has mere­ly in­creased the adept­ness with which sub­sti­tutes can
be pro­duced and pack­aged.</p><p>Yet the de­tec­tive sto­ry, even in its most con­ven­tion­al form, is
dif­fi­cult to write well. Good spec­i­mens of the art are much rar­er than
good se­ri­ous nov­els. Sec­ond-rate items out­last most of the high-ve­loc­i­ty
fic­tion, and a great many that should nev­er have been born sim­ply refuse
to die at all. They are as durable as the stat­ues in pub­lic parks and
just about as dull.</p><p>This fact is an­noy­ing to peo­ple of what is called dis­cern­ment. They do
not like it that pen­e­trat­ing and im­por­tant works of fic­tion of a few
years back stand on their spe­cial shelf in the li­brary marked
<q>Best-sell­ers of Yes­ter­year</q> or some­thing, and no­body goes near them but
an oc­ca­sion­al short­sight­ed cus­tomer who bends down, peers briefly and
hur­ries away; while at the same time old ladies jos­tle each oth­er at the
mys­tery shelf to grab off some item of the same vin­tage with such a
ti­tle as <q>The Triple Petu­nia Mur­der Case</q> or <q>In­spec­tor Pinch­bot­tle to
the Res­cue</q>. They do not like it at all that <q>real­ly im­por­tant books</q>
(and some of them are too, in a way) get the frosty mitt at the reprint
counter while <q>Death Wears Yel­low Garters</q> is put out in edi­tions of
fifty or one hun­dred thou­sand copies on the news­stands of the coun­try,
and is ob­vi­ous­ly not there just to say good­bye.</p><p>To tell the truth, I do not like it very much my­self. In my less stilt­ed
mo­ments I too write de­tec­tive sto­ries, and all this im­mor­tal­i­ty makes
just a lit­tle too much com­pe­ti­tion. Even Ein­stein couldn’t get very far
if three hun­dred trea­tis­es of the high­er physics were pub­lished every
year, and sev­er­al thou­sand oth­ers in some form or oth­er were hang­ing
around in ex­cel­lent con­di­tion, and be­ing read too.</p><p>Hem­ing­way says some­where that the good writer com­petes only with the
dead. The good de­tec­tive sto­ry writer (there must af­ter all be a few)
com­petes not only with all the un­buried dead but with all the hosts of
the liv­ing as well. And on al­most equal terms; for it is one of the
qual­i­ties of this kind of writ­ing that the thing that makes peo­ple read
it nev­er goes out of style. The hero’s tie may be a lit­tle out of the
mode and the good gray in­spec­tor may ar­rive in a dog­cart in­stead of a
stream­lined sedan with siren scream­ing, but what he does when he gets
there is the same old futz­ing around with timeta­bles and bits of charred
pa­per and who tram­pled the jol­ly old flow­er­ing ar­bu­tus un­der the li­brary
win­dow.</p><p>I have, how­ev­er, a less sor­did in­ter­est in the mat­ter. It seems to me
that pro­duc­tion of de­tec­tive sto­ries on so large a scale, and by writ­ers
whose im­me­di­ate re­ward is small and whose need of crit­i­cal praise is
al­most nil, would not be pos­si­ble at all if the job took any tal­ent. In
that sense the raised eye­brow of the crit­ic and the shod­dy mer­chan­dis­ing
of the pub­lish­er are per­fect­ly log­i­cal. The av­er­age de­tec­tive sto­ry is
prob­a­bly no worse than the av­er­age nov­el, but you nev­er see the av­er­age
nov­el. It doesn’t get pub­lished. The av­er­age-or only slight­ly above
av­er­age-de­tec­tive sto­ry does. Not only is it pub­lished but it is sold in
small quan­ti­ties to rental li­braries and it is read. There are even a
few op­ti­mists who buy it at the full re­tail price of two dol­lars,
be­cause it looks so fresh and new and there is a pic­ture of a corpse on
the cov­er.</p><p>And the strange thing is that this av­er­age, more than mid­dling dull,
pooped-out piece of ut­ter­ly un­re­al and me­chan­i­cal fic­tion is real­ly not
very dif­fer­ent from what are called the mas­ter­pieces of the art. It
drags on a lit­tle more slow­ly, the di­a­logue is a shade gray­er, the
card­board out of which the char­ac­ters are cut is a shade thin­ner, and
the cheat­ing is a lit­tle more ob­vi­ous. But it is the same kind of book,
Where­as the good nov­el is not at all the same kind of book as the bad
nov­el. It is about en­tire­ly dif­fer­ent things. But the good de­tec­tive
sto­ry and the bad de­tec­tive sto­ry are about ex­act­ly the same things, and
they are about them in very much the same way. There are rea­sons for
this too, and rea­sons for the rea­sons; there al­ways are.</p><p>I sup­pose the prin­ci­pal dilem­ma of the tra­di­tion­al or clas­sic or
straight de­duc­tive or log­ic and de­duc­tion nov­el of de­tec­tion is that for
any ap­proach to per­fec­tion it de­mands a com­bi­na­tion of qual­i­ties not
found in the same mind. The cool­head­ed con­struc­tion­ist does not also
come across with live­ly char­ac­ters, sharp di­a­logue, a sense of pace, and
an acute use of ob­served de­tail. The grim lo­gi­cian has as much
at­mos­phere as a draw­ing board. The sci­en­tif­ic sleuth has a nice new
shiny lab­o­ra­to­ry, but I’m sor­ry I can’t re­mem­ber the face. The fel­low
who can write you a vivid and col­or­ful prose sim­ply will not be both­ered
with the coolie la­bor of break­ing down un­break­able al­i­bis.</p><p>The mas­ter of rare knowl­edge is liv­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal­ly in the age of the
hoop skirt. If you know all you should know about ce­ram­ics and Egypt­ian
needle­work, you don’t know any­thing at all about the po­lice. If you know
that plat­inum won’t melt un­der about 30000 F. by it­self, but will melt
at the glance of a pair of deep blue eyes if you put it near a bar of
lead, then you don’t know how men make love in the twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry.
And if you know enough about the el­e­gant flâner­ie of the pre­war French
Riv­iera to lay your sto­ry in that lo­cale, you don’t know that a cou­ple
of cap­sules of bar­bi­tal small enough to be swal­lowed will not only not
kill a man-they will not even put him to sleep if he fights against
them.</p><p>Every de­tec­tive sto­ry writer makes mis­takes, of course, and none will
ever know as much as he should. Co­nan Doyle made mis­takes which
com­plete­ly in­val­i­dat­ed some of his sto­ries, but he was a pi­o­neer, and
Sher­lock Holmes af­ter all is most­ly an at­ti­tude and a few dozen lines of
un­for­get­table di­a­logue. It is the ladies and gen­tle­men of what Mr.
Howard Hay­craft(in his book <q>Mur­der for Plea­sure</q>) calls the Gold­en Age
of de­tec­tive fic­tion that real­ly get me down. This age is not re­mote.
For Mr. Hay­craft’s pur­pose it starts af­ter the First World War and lasts
up to about 1930. For all prac­ti­cal pur­pos­es it is still here. Two
thirds or three quar­ters of all the de­tec­tive sto­ries pub­lished still
ad­here to the for­mu­la the gi­ants of this era cre­at­ed, per­fect­ed,
pol­ished, and sold to the world as prob­lems in log­ic and de­duc­tion.</p><p>These are stern words, but be not alarmed. They are only words. Let us
glance at one of the glo­ries of the lit­er­a­ture, an ac­knowl­edged
mas­ter­piece of the art of fool­ing the read­er with­out cheat­ing him. It is
called <q>The Red House Mys­tery</q>, was writ­ten by A. A. Milne, and has been
named by Alexan­der Wooll­cott (rather a fast man with a su­perla­tive) <q>one
of the three best mys­tery sto­ries of all time.</q> Words of that size are
not spo­ken light­ly. The book was pub­lished in 1922 but is time­less, and
might as eas­i­ly have been pub­lished in July, 1939, or, with a few slight
changes, last week. It ran thir­teen edi­tions and seems to have been in
print, in the orig­i­nal for­mat, for about six­teen years. That hap­pens to
few books of any kind. It is an agree­able book, light, amus­ing in the
Punch style, writ­ten with a de­cep­tive smooth­ness that is not so easy as
it looks.</p><p>It con­cerns Mark Ablett’s im­per­son­ation of his broth­er Robert as a hoax
on his friends. Mark is the own­er of the Red House, a typ­i­cal
labur­num-and-lodge-gate Eng­lish coun­try house. He has a sec­re­tary who
en­cour­ages him and abets him in this im­per­son­ation, and who is go­ing to
mur­der him if he pulls it off. No­body around the Red House has ever seen
Robert, fif­teen years ab­sent in Aus­tralia and known by re­pute as a
no-good. A let­ter is talked about (but nev­er shown) an­nounc­ing Robert’s
ar­rival, and Mark hints it will not be a pleas­ant oc­ca­sion. One
af­ter­noon, then, the sup­posed Robert ar­rives, iden­ti­fies him­self to a
cou­ple of ser­vants, is shown into the study. Mark goes in af­ter him
(ac­cord­ing to tes­ti­mo­ny at the in­quest). Robert is then found dead on
the floor with a bul­let hole in his face, and of course Mark has
van­ished into thin air. Ar­rive the po­lice, who sus­pect Mark must be the
mur­der­er, re­move the de­bris, and pro­ceed with the in­ves­ti­ga­tion-and in
due course, with the in­quest.</p><p>Milne is aware of one very dif­fi­cult hur­dle and tries as well as he can
to get over it. Since the sec­re­tary is go­ing to mur­der Mark, once Mark
has es­tab­lished him­self as Robert, the im­per­son­ation has to con­tin­ue and
fool the po­lice. Since, also, every­body around the Red House knows Mark
in­ti­mate­ly, dis­guise is nec­es­sary. This is achieved by shav­ing off
Mark’s beard, rough­en­ing his hands (<q>not the hands of a man­i­cured
gen­tle­man</q>-tes­ti­mo­ny), and the use of a gruff voice and rough man­ner.</p><p>But this is not enough. The cops are go­ing to have the body and the
clothes on it and what­ev­er is in the pock­ets. There­fore none of this
must sug­gest Mark. Milne there­fore works like a switch en­gine to put
over the mo­ti­va­tion that Mark is such a thor­ough­ly con­ceit­ed per­former
that he dress­es the part down to the socks and un­der­wear (from all of
which the sec­re­tary has re­moved the mak­er’s la­bels), like a ham black­ing
him­self all over to play Oth­el­lo. If the read­er will buy this (and the
sales record shows he must have), Milne fig­ures he is sol­id. Yet,
how­ev­er light in tex­ture the sto­ry may be, it is of­fered as a prob­lem of
log­ic and de­duc­tion.</p><p>If it is not that, it is noth­ing at all. There is noth­ing else for it to
be. If the sit­u­a­tion is false, you can­not even ac­cept it as a light
nov­el, for there is no sto­ry for the light nov­el to be about. If the
prob­lem does not con­tain the el­e­ments of truth and plau­si­bil­i­ty, it is
no prob­lem; if the log­ic is an il­lu­sion, there is noth­ing to de­duce. If
the im­per­son­ation is im­pos­si­ble once the read­er is told the con­di­tions
it must ful­fill, then the whole thing is a fraud. Not a de­lib­er­ate
fraud, be­cause Milne would not have writ­ten the sto­ry if he had known
what he was up against. He is up against a num­ber of dead­ly things, none
of which he even con­sid­ers. Nor, ap­par­ent­ly, does the ca­su­al read­er, who
wants to like the sto­ry-hence takes it at its face val­ue. But the read­er
is not called upon to know the facts of life when the au­thor does not.
The au­thor is the ex­pert in the case.</p><p>Here is what this au­thor ig­nores:
</p><ol><li>The coro­ner holds for­mal jury in­quest on a body for which no le­gal
com­pe­tent iden­ti­fi­ca­tion is of­fered. A coro­ner, usu­al­ly in a big city,
will some­times hold in­quest on a body that can­not be iden­ti­fied, if the
record of such an in­quest has or may have a val­ue (fire, dis­as­ter,
ev­i­dence of mur­der). No such rea­son ex­ists here, and there is no one to
iden­ti­fy the body. Wit­ness­es said the man said he was Robert Ablett.
This is mere pre­sump­tion, and has weight only if noth­ing con­flicts with
it. Iden­ti­fi­ca­tion is a con­di­tion prece­dent to an in­quest. It is a
mat­ter of law. Even in death a man has a right to his own iden­ti­ty. The
coro­ner will, wher­ev­er hu­man­ly pos­si­ble, en­force that right. To ne­glect
it would be a vi­o­la­tion of his of­fice.</li><li>Since Mark Ablett, miss­ing and sus­pect­ed of the mur­der, can­not
de­fend him­self, all ev­i­dence of his move­ments be­fore and af­ter the
mur­der is vi­tal (as also whether he has mon­ey to run away on); yet all
such ev­i­dence is giv­en by the man clos­est to the mur­der and is with­out
cor­rob­o­ra­tion. It is au­to­mat­i­cal­ly sus­pect un­til proved true.</li><li>The po­lice find by di­rect in­ves­ti­ga­tion that Robert Ablett was not
well thought of in his na­tive vil­lage. Some­body there must have known
him. No such per­son was brought to the in­quest. (The sto­ry couldn’t
stand it.)</li><li>The po­lice know there is an el­e­ment of threat in Robert’s sup­posed
vis­it, and that it is con­nect­ed with the mur­der must be ob­vi­ous to them.
Yet they make no at­tempt to check Robert in Aus­tralia, or find out what
char­ac­ter he had there, or what as­so­ciates, or even if he ac­tu­al­ly came
to Eng­land, and with whom. (If they had, they would have found out he
had been dead three years.)</li><li>The po­lice sur­geon ex­am­ines a body with a re­cent­ly shaved beard
(ex­pos­ing un­weath­ered skin) and ar­ti­fi­cial­ly rough­ened hands, but it is
the body of a wealthy, soft-liv­ing man, long res­i­dent in a cool cli­mate.
Robert was a rough in­di­vid­ual and had lived fif­teen years in Aus­tralia.
That is the sur­geon’s in­for­ma­tion. It is im­pos­si­ble he would have
no­ticed noth­ing to con­flict with it.</li><li>The clothes are name­less, emp­ty, and have had the la­bels re­moved.
Yet the man wear­ing them as­sert­ed an iden­ti­ty. The pre­sump­tion that he
was not what he said he was is over­pow­er­ing. Noth­ing what­ev­er is done
about his pe­cu­liar cir­cum­stance. It is nev­er even men­tioned as be­ing
pe­cu­liar.</li><li>A man is miss­ing, a well-known lo­cal man, and a body in the morgue
close­ly re­sem­bles him. It is im­pos­si­ble that the po­lice should not at
once elim­i­nate the chance that the miss­ing man is the dead man. Noth­ing
would be eas­i­er than to prove it. Not even to think of it is in­cred­i­ble.
It makes id­iots of the po­lice, so that a brash am­a­teur may star­tle the
world with a fake so­lu­tion.</li></ol><p>The de­tec­tive in the case is an in­sou­ciant am­a­teur named An­tho­ny
Gilling­ham, a nice lad with a cheery eye, a nice lit­tle flat in town,
and that airy man­ner. He is not mak­ing any mon­ey on the as­sign­ment, but
is al­ways avail­able when the lo­cal gen­darmerie los­es its note­book. The
Eng­lish po­lice en­dure him with their cus­tom­ary sto­icism, but I shud­der
to think what the boys down at the Homi­cide Bu­reau in my city would do
to him.</p><p>There are even less plau­si­ble ex­am­ples of the art than this. In <q>Trent’s
Last Case</q> (of­ten called the per­fect de­tec­tive sto­ry you have to ac­cept
the premise that a gi­ant of in­ter­na­tion­al fi­nance, whose light­est frown
makes Wall Street quiver like a chi­huahua, will plot his own death so as
to hang his sec­re­tary, and that the sec­re­tary when pinched will main­tain
an aris­to­crat­ic si­lence-the old Eton­ian in him, maybe. I have known
rel­a­tive­ly few in­ter­na­tion­al fi­nanciers, but I rather think the au­thor
of this nov­el has (if pos­si­ble) known few­er.</p><p>There is an­oth­er one, by Free­man Wills Crofts (the sound­est builder of
them all when he doesn’t get too fan­cy), where­in a mur­der­er, by the aid
of make-up, split-sec­ond tim­ing and some very sweet eva­sive ac­tion,
im­per­son­ates the man he has just killed and there­by gets him alive and
dis­tant from the place of the crime. There is one by Dorothy Say­ers in
which a man is mur­dered alone at night in his house by a me­chan­i­cal­ly
re­leased weight which works be­cause he al­ways turns the ra­dio on at just
such a mo­ment, al­ways stands in just such a po­si­tion in front of it, and
al­ways bends over just so far. A cou­ple of inch­es ei­ther way and the
cus­tomers would get a rain check. This is what is vul­gar­ly known as
hav­ing God sit in your lap; a mur­der­er who needs that much help from
Prov­i­dence must be in the wrong busi­ness.</p><p>And there is a scheme of Agatha Christie’s fea­tur­ing M. Her­cule Poirot,
that in­ge­nious Bel­gian who talks in a lit­er­al trans­la­tion of school-boy
French. By duly mess­ing around with his <q>lit­tle gray cells</q> M. Poirot
de­cides that since no­body on a cer­tain through sleep­er could have done
the mur­der alone, every­body did it to­geth­er, break­ing the process down
into a se­ries of sim­ple op­er­a­tions like as­sem­bling an egg beat­er. This
is the type that is guar­an­teed to knock the keen­est mind for a loop.
Only a halfwit could guess it.</p><p>There are much bet­ter plots by these same writ­ers and by oth­ers of their
school. There maybe one some­where that would real­ly stand up un­der close
scruti­ny. It would be fun to read it, even if I did have to go back to
page 47 and re­fresh my mem­o­ry about ex­act­ly what time the sec­ond
gar­den­er pot­ted the prize-win­ning tea-rose be­go­nia. There is noth­ing new
about these sto­ries and noth­ing old. The ones I men­tioned are all
Eng­lish be­cause the au­thor­i­ties, such as they are, seem to feel that the
Eng­lish writ­ers had an edge in this drea­ry rou­tine and that the
Amer­i­cans, even the cre­ator of Phi­lo Vance, only make the Ju­nior
Var­si­ty.</p><p>This, the clas­sic de­tec­tive sto­ry, has learned noth­ing and for­got­ten
noth­ing. It is the sto­ry you will find al­most any week in the big shiny
mag­a­zines, hand­some­ly il­lus­trat­ed, and pay­ing due def­er­ence to vir­ginal
love and the right kind of lux­u­ry goods. Per­haps the tem­po has be­come a
tri­fle faster and the di­a­logue a lit­tle more glib. There are more frozen
daiquiris and stingers and few­er glass­es of crusty old port, more
clothes by Vogue and dé­cors by <q>House Beau­ti­ful</q>, more chic, but not
more truth. We spend more time in Mi­a­mi ho­tels and Cape Cod sum­mer
colonies and go not so of­ten down by the old gray sun­di­al in the
Eliz­a­bethan gar­den.</p><p>But fun­da­men­tal­ly it is the same care­ful group­ing of sus­pects, the same
ut­ter­ly in­com­pre­hen­si­ble trick of how some­body stabbed Mrs. Pot­ting­ton
Postleth­waite III with the sol­id plat­inum poniard just as she flat­ted on
the top note of the <q>Bell Song</q> from Lak­mé in the pres­ence of fif­teen
ill-as­sort­ed guests; the same in­genue in fur-trimmed pa­ja­mas scream­ing
in the night to make the com­pa­ny pop in and out of doors and ball up the
timetable; the same moody si­lence next day as they sit around sip­ping
Sin­ga­pore slings and sneer­ing at each oth­er, while the flat­feet crawl to
and fro un­der the Per­sian rugs, with their der­by hats on.</p><p>Per­son­al­ly I like the Eng­lish style bet­ter. It is not quite so brit­tle
and the peo­ple as a rule just wear clothes and drink drinks. There is
more sense of back­ground, as if Cheese­cake Manor real­ly ex­ist­ed all
around and not just in the part the cam­era sees; there are more long
walks over the downs and the char­ac­ters don’t all try to be­have as if
they had just been test­ed by MGM. The Eng­lish may not al­ways be the best
writ­ers in the world, but they are in­com­pa­ra­bly the best dull Writ­ers.</p><p>There is a very sim­ple state­ment to be made about all these sto­ries:
they do not real­ly come off in­tel­lec­tu­al­ly as prob­lems, and they do not
come off ar­tis­ti­cal­ly as fic­tion. They are too con­trived, and too lit­tle
aware of what goes on in the world. They try to be hon­est, but hon­esty
is an art. The poor writer is dis­hon­est with­out know­ing it, and the
fair­ly good one can be dis­hon­est be­cause he doesn’t know what to be
hon­est about. He thinks a com­pli­cat­ed mur­der scheme which baf­fled the
lazy read­er, who won’t be both­ered item­iz­ing the de­tails, will also
baf­fle the po­lice, whose busi­ness is with de­tails.</p><p>The boys with their feet on the desks know that the eas­i­est mur­der case
in the world to break is the one some­body tried to get very cute with;
the one that real­ly both­ers them is the mur­der some­body thought of only
two min­utes be­fore he pulled it off. But if the writ­ers of this fic­tion
wrote about the kind of mur­ders that hap­pen, they would also have to
write about the au­then­tic fla­vor of life as it is lived. And since they
can­not do that, they pre­tend that what they do is what should be done.
Which is beg­ging the ques­tion-and the best of them know it.</p><p>In her in­tro­duc­tion to the first <q>Om­nibus of Crime</q>, Dorothy Say­ers
wrote: <q>It (the de­tec­tive sto­ry) does not, and by hy­poth­e­sis nev­er can,
at­tain the lofti­est lev­el of lit­er­ary achieve­ment.</q> And she sug­gest­ed
some­where else that this is be­cause it is a <q>lit­er­a­ture of es­cape</q> and
not <q>a lit­er­a­ture of ex­pres­sion.</q> I do not know what the lofti­est lev­el
of lit­er­ary achieve­ment is: nei­ther did Aeschy­lus or Shake­speare;
nei­ther does Miss Say­ers. Oth­er things be­ing equal, which they nev­er
are, a more pow­er­ful theme will pro­voke a more pow­er­ful per­for­mance. Yet
some very dull books have been writ­ten about God, and some very fine
ones about how to make a liv­ing and stay fair­ly hon­est. It is al­ways a
mat­ter of who writes the stuff, and what he has in him to write it with.</p><p>As for <q>lit­er­a­ture of ex­pres­sion</q> and <q>lit­er­a­ture of es­cape</q>-this is
crit­ics’ jar­gon, a use of ab­stract words as if they had ab­solute
mean­ings. Every­thing writ­ten with vi­tal­i­ty ex­press­es that vi­tal­i­ty:
there are no dull sub­jects, only dull minds. All men who read es­cape
from some­thing else into what lies be­hind the print­ed page; the qual­i­ty
of the dream may be ar­gued, but its re­lease has be­come a func­tion­al
ne­ces­si­ty. All men must es­cape at times from the dead­ly rhythm of their
pri­vate thoughts. It is part of the process of life among think­ing
be­ings. It is one of the things that dis­tin­guish them from the
three-toed sloth; he ap­par­ent­ly-one can nev­er be quite sure-is per­fect­ly
con­tent hang­ing up­side down on a branch, not even read­ing Wal­ter
Lipp­mann. I hold no par­tic­u­lar brief for the de­tec­tive sto­ry as the
ide­al es­cape. I mere­ly say that all read­ing for plea­sure is es­cape,
whether it be Greek, math­e­mat­ics, as­tron­o­my, Benedet­to Croce, or <q>The
Di­ary of the For­got­ten Man</q>. To say oth­er­wise is to be an in­tel­lec­tu­al
snob, and a ju­ve­nile at the art of liv­ing.</p><p>I do not think such con­sid­er­a­tions moved Miss Dorothy Say­ers to her
es­say in crit­i­cal fu­til­i­ty.</p><p>I think what was real­ly gnaw­ing at Miss Say­ers’ mind was the slow
re­al­iza­tion that her kind of de­tec­tive sto­ry was an arid for­mu­la which
could not even sat­is­fy its own im­pli­ca­tions. It was sec­ond-grade
lit­er­a­ture be­cause it was not about the things that could make
first-grade lit­er­a­ture. If it start­ed out to be about real peo­ple (and
she could write about them-her mi­nor char­ac­ters show that), they must
very soon do un­re­al things in or­der to form the ar­ti­fi­cial pat­tern
re­quired by the plot. When they did un­re­al things, they ceased to be
real them­selves. They be­came pup­pets and card­board lovers and
pa­pi­er-mâché vil­lains and de­tec­tives of ex­quis­ite and im­pos­si­ble
gen­til­i­ty.</p><p>The only kind of writer who could be hap­py with these prop­er­ties was the
one who did not know what re­al­i­ty was. Dorothy Say­ers’ own sto­ries show
that she was an­noyed by this trite­ness; the weak­est el­e­ment in them is
the part that makes them de­tec­tive sto­ries, the strongest the part which
could be re­moved with­out touch­ing the <q>prob­lem of log­ic and de­duc­tion.</q>
Yet she could not or would not give her char­ac­ters their heads and let
them make their own mys­tery. It took a much sim­pler and more di­rect mind
than hers to do that.</p><p>In <q>The Long Week End</q>, which is a dras­ti­cal­ly com­pe­tent ac­count of
Eng­lish life and man­ners in the decades fol­low­ing the First World War,
Robert Graves and Alan Hodge gave some at­ten­tion to the de­tec­tive sto­ry.
They were just as tra­di­tion­al­ly Eng­lish as the or­na­ments of the Gold­en
Age, and they wrote of the time in which these writ­ers were al­most as
well known as any writ­ers in the world. Their hooks in one form or
an­oth­er sold into the mil­lions, and in a dozen lan­guages. These were the
peo­ple who fixed the form and es­tab­lished the rules and found­ed the
fa­mous De­tec­tion Club, which is a Par­nas­sus of Eng­lish writ­ers of
mys­tery. Its ros­ter in­cludes prac­ti­cal­ly every im­por­tant writer of
de­tec­tive fic­tion since Co­nan Doyle.</p><p>But Graves and Hodge de­cid­ed that dur­ing this whole pe­ri­od only one
first-class writer had writ­ten de­tec­tive sto­ries at all. An Amer­i­can,
Dashiell Ham­mett. Tra­di­tion­al or not, Graves and Hodge were not
fud­dy­dud­dy con­nois­seurs of the sec­on­drate; they could see what went on
in the world and that the de­tec­tive sto­ry of their time didn’t; and they
were aware that writ­ers who have the vi­sion and the abil­i­ty to pro­duce
real fic­tion do not pro­duce un­re­al fic­tion.</p><p>How orig­i­nal a writer Ham­mett real­ly was it isn’t easy to de­cide now,
even if it mat­tered. He was one of a group-the only one who achieved
crit­i­cal recog­ni­tion-who wrote or tried to write re­al­is­tic mys­tery
fic­tion. All lit­er­ary move­ments are like this; some one in­di­vid­ual is
picked out to rep­re­sent the whole move­ment; he is usu­al­ly the
cul­mi­na­tion of the move­ment. Ham­mett was the ace per­former, but there is
noth­ing in his work that is not im­plic­it in the ear­ly nov­els and short
sto­ries of Hem­ing­way.</p><p>Yet, for all I know, Hem­ing­way, may have learned some­thing from Ham­mett
as well as from writ­ers like Dreis­er, Ring Lard­ner, Carl Sand­burg,
Sher­wood An­der­son, and him­self. A rather rev­o­lu­tion­ary de­bunk­ing of both
the lan­guage and the ma­te­r­i­al of fic­tion had been go­ing on for some
time. It prob­a­bly start­ed in po­et­ry; al­most every­thing does. You can
take it clear back to Walt Whit­man, if you like. But Ham­mett ap­plied it
to the de­tec­tive sto­ry, and this, be­cause of its heavy crust of Eng­lish
gen­til­i­ty and Amer­i­can pseudo­gen­til­i­ty, was pret­ty hard to get mov­ing.</p><p>I doubt that Ham­mett had any de­lib­er­ate artis­tic aims what­ev­er; he was
try­ing to make a liv­ing by writ­ing some­thing he had first­hand
in­for­ma­tion about. He made some of it up; all writ­ers do; but it had a
ba­sis in fact; it was made up out of real things. The only re­al­i­ty the
Eng­lish de­tec­tion writ­ers knew was the con­ver­sa­tion­al ac­cent of Sur­biton
and Bogn­or Reg­is. If they wrote about dukes and Venet­ian vas­es, they
knew no more about them out of their own ex­pe­ri­ence than the well­heeled
Hol­ly­wood char­ac­ter knows about the French Mod­ernists that hang in his
Bel-Air château or the semi-an­tique Chip­pen­dale-cum-cob­bler’s bench that
he uses for a cof­fee ta­ble. Ham­mett took mur­der out of the Venet­ian vase
and dropped it into the al­ley; it doesn’t have to stay there for­ev­er,
but it looked like a good idea to get as far as pos­si­ble from Emi­ly
Post’s idea of how a well-bred debu­tante gnaws a chick­en wing.</p><p>Ham­mett wrote at first (and al­most to the end) for peo­ple with a sharp,
ag­gres­sive at­ti­tude to life. They were not afraid of the seamy side of
things; they lived there. Vi­o­lence did not dis­may them; it was right
down their street. Ham­mett gave mur­der back to the kind of peo­ple that
com­mit it for rea­sons, not just to pro­vide a corpse; and with the means
at hand, not hand-wrought du­el­ing pis­tols, cu­rare and trop­i­cal fish. He
put these peo­ple down on pa­per as they were, and he made them talk and
think in the lan­guage they cus­tom­ar­i­ly used for these pur­pos­es.</p><p>He had style, but his au­di­ence didn’t know it, be­cause it was in a
lan­guage not sup­posed to be ca­pa­ble of such re­fine­ments. They thought
they were get­ting a good meaty melo­dra­ma writ­ten in the kind of lin­go
they imag­ined they spoke them­selves. It was, in a sense, but it was much
more. All lan­guage be­gins with speech, and the speech of com­mon men at
that, but when it de­vel­ops to the point of be­com­ing a lit­er­ary medi­um it
only looks like speech. Ham­mett’s style at its worst was as for­mal­ized
as a page of Mar­ius the Epi­cure­an; at its best it could say al­most
any­thing. I be­lieve this style, which does not be­long to Ham­mett or to
any­body, but is the Amer­i­can lan­guage (and not even ex­clu­sive­ly that any
more), can say things he did not know how to say, or feel the need of
say­ing. In his hands it had no over­tones, left no echo, evoked no im­age
be­yond a dis­tant hill.</p><p>Ham­mett is said to have lacked heart; yet the sto­ry he him­self thought
the most of is the record of a man’s de­vo­tion to a friend. He was spare,
fru­gal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only the best
writ­ers can ever do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed nev­er to have
been writ­ten be­fore.</p><p>With all this he did not wreck the for­mal de­tec­tive sto­ry. No­body can;
pro­duc­tion de­mands a form that can be pro­duced. Re­al­ism takes too much
tal­ent, too much knowl­edge, too much aware­ness. Ham­mett may have
loos­ened it up a lit­tle here, and sharp­ened it a lit­tle there. Cer­tain­ly
all but the stu­pid­est and most mere­tri­cious writ­ers are more con­scious
of their ar­ti­fi­cial­i­ty than they used to be. And he demon­strat­ed that
the de­tec­tive sto­ry can be im­por­tant writ­ing. <q>The Mal­tese Fal­con</q> may
or may not be a work of ge­nius, but an art which is ca­pa­ble of it is not
<q>by hy­poth­e­sis</q> in­ca­pable of any­thing. Once a de­tec­tive sto­ry can be as
good as this, only the pedants will deny that it could be even bet­ter.</p><p>Ham­mett did some­thing else; he made the de­tec­tive sto­ry fun to write,
not an ex­haust­ing con­cate­na­tion of in­signif­i­cant clues. With­out him
there might not have been a re­gion­al mys­tery as clever as Per­ci­val
Wilde’s In­quest, or an iron­ic study as able as Ray­mond Post­gate’s
<q>Ver­dict of Twelve</q>, or a sav­age piece of in­tel­lec­tu­al dou­ble-talk like
Ken­neth Fear­ing’s <q>The Dag­ger of the Mind</q>, or a tra­gi-com­ic
ide­al­iza­tion of the mur­der­er as in Don­ald Hen­der­son’s <q>Mr. Bowl­ing Buys
a News­pa­per</q>, or even a gay Hol­ly­wood­i­an gam­bol like Richard Sale’s
<q>Lazarus No. 7</q>.</p><p>The re­al­is­tic style is easy to abuse: from haste, from lack of
aware­ness, from in­abil­i­ty to bridge the chasm that lies be­tween what a
writer would like to be able to say and what he ac­tu­al­ly knows how to
say. It is easy to fake; bru­tal­i­ty is not strength, flip­ness is not wit,
edge-of-the-chair writ­ing can be as bor­ing as flat writ­ing; dal­liance
with promis­cu­ous blondes can be very dull stuff when de­scribed by goaty
young men with no oth­er pur­pose in mind than to de­scribe dal­liance with
promis­cu­ous blondes. There has been so much of this sort of thing that
if a char­ac­ter in a de­tec­tive sto­ry says <q>Yeah,</q> the au­thor is
au­to­mat­i­cal­ly a Ham­mett im­i­ta­tor.</p><p>And there are still a num­ber of peo­ple around who say that Ham­mett did
not write de­tec­tive sto­ries at all-mere­ly hard­boiled chron­i­cles of mean
streets with a per­func­to­ry mys­tery el­e­ment dropped in like the olive in
a mar­ti­ni. These are the flus­tered old ladies-of both sex­es (or no sex)
and al­most all ages-who like their mur­ders scent­ed with mag­no­lia
blos­soms and do not care to be re­mind­ed that mur­der is an act of
in­fi­nite cru­el­ty, even if the per­pe­tra­tors some­times look like play­boys
or col­lege pro­fes­sors or nice moth­er­ly women with soft­ly gray­ing hair.</p><p>There are also a few bad­ly scared cham­pi­ons of the for­mal or clas­sic
mys­tery who think that no sto­ry is a de­tec­tive sto­ry which does not pose
a for­mal and ex­act prob­lem and arrange the clues around it with neat
la­bels on them. Such would point out, for ex­am­ple, that in read­ing <q>The
Mal­tese Fal­con</q> no one con­cerns him­self with who killed Spade’s part­ner,
Archer (which is the only for­mal prob­lem of the sto­ry), be­cause the
read­er is kept think­ing about some­thing else. Yet in <q>The Glass Key</q> the
read­er is con­stant­ly re­mind­ed that the ques­tion is who killed Tay­lor
Hen­ry, and ex­act­ly the same ef­fect is ob­tained-an ef­fect of move­ment,
in­trigue, cross-pur­pos­es, and the grad­ual elu­ci­da­tion of char­ac­ter,
which is all the de­tec­tive sto­ry has any right to be about any­way. The
rest is spillikins in the par­lor.</p><p>But all this (and Ham­mett too) is for me not quite enough. The re­al­ist
in mur­der writes of a world in which gang­sters can rule na­tions and
al­most rule cities, in which ho­tels and apart­ment hous­es and cel­e­brat­ed
restau­rants are owned by men who made their mon­ey out of broth­els, in
which a screen star can be the fin­ger man for a mob. and the nice man
down the hall is a boss of the num­bers rack­et; a world where a judge
with a cel­lar full of boot­leg liquor can send a man to jail for hav­ing a
pint in his pock­et, where the may­or of your town may have con­doned
mur­der as an in­stru­ment of mon­ey-mak­ing, where no man can walk down a
dark street in safe­ty be­cause law and or­der are things we talk about but
re­frain from prac­tic­ing; a world where you may wit­ness a holdup in broad
day­light and see who did it, but you will fade quick­ly back into the
crowd rather than tell any­one, be­cause the holdup men may have friends
with long guns, or the po­lice may not like your tes­ti­mo­ny, and in any
case the shys­ter for the de­fense will be al­lowed to abuse and vil­i­fy you
in open court, be­fore a jury of se­lect­ed mo­rons, with­out any but the
most per­func­to­ry in­ter­fer­ence from a po­lit­i­cal judge.</p><p>It is not a fra­grant world, but it is the world you live in, and cer­tain
writ­ers with tough minds and a cool spir­it of de­tach­ment can make very
in­ter­est­ing and even amus­ing pat­terns out of it. It is not fun­ny that a
man should be killed, but it is some­times fun­ny that he should be killed
for so lit­tle, and that his death should be the coin of what we call
civ­i­liza­tion. All this still is not quite enough.</p><p>In every­thing that can be called art there is a qual­i­ty of re­demp­tion.
It may be pure tragedy, if it is high tragedy, and it may be pity and
irony, and it may be the rau­cous laugh­ter of the strong man. But down
these mean streets a man must go who is not him­self mean, who is nei­ther
tar­nished nor afraid. The de­tec­tive in this kind of sto­ry must be such a
man. He is the hero; he is every­thing. He must be a com­plete man and a
com­mon man and yet an un­usu­al man. He must be, to use a rather weath­ered
phrase, a man of hon­or-by in­stinct, by in­evitabil­i­ty, with­out thought of
it, and cer­tain­ly with­out say­ing it. He must be the best man in his
world and a good enough man for any world. I do not care much about his
pri­vate life; he is nei­ther a eu­nuch nor a satyr; I think he might
se­duce a duchess and I am quite sure he would not spoil a vir­gin; if he
is a man of hon­or in one thing, he is that in all things.</p><p>He is a rel­a­tive­ly poor man, or he would not be a de­tec­tive at all. He
is a com­mon man or he could not go among com­mon peo­ple. He has a sense
of char­ac­ter, or he would not know his job. He will take no man’s mon­ey
dis­hon­est­ly and no man’s in­so­lence with­out a due and dis­pas­sion­ate
re­venge. He is a lone­ly man and his pride is that you will treat him as
a proud man or be very sor­ry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of
his age talks-that is, with rude wit, a live­ly sense of the grotesque, a
dis­gust for sham, and a con­tempt for pet­ti­ness.</p><p>The sto­ry is this man’s ad­ven­ture in search of a hid­den truth, and it
would be no ad­ven­ture if it did not hap­pen to a man fit for ad­ven­ture.
He has a range of aware­ness that star­tles you, but it be­longs to him by
right, be­cause it be­longs to the world he lives in. If there were enough
like him, the world would be a very safe place to live in, with­out
be­com­ing too dull to be worth liv­ing in.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>© Aerius, 2004</p><p>© R.Chan­dler, The Sim­ple Art of Mur­der, 1950</p><p>Source: R.Chan­dler. The Sim­ple Art of Mur­der (col­lec­tion)</p><p>E-Text: Greylib .</p><p>* * * * *</p><section class="footnotes"><hr/><ol></ol></section>
